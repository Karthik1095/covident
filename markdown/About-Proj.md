## What is this?

**Background**

The ensuing Covid 19 pandemic is poised to change the dynamics of dental practice at least in the short to medium term. A flurry of useful and questionable information about do’s and don’ts are being pushed towards dentists these days through a multitude of channels. It is beyond an average dentist to scan  and glean actionable information from this jumble. 

Therefore, we created this easily accessible curated repository of **peer reviewed** current literature relevant to Covid 19 and dentistry. We use systematic review methodology to find, screen and summarize and rate pertinent information. In an uncertain time where quality information and time are equally valuable resources we hope our efforts will support evidence based information among dentists. 

**Terms of Use**

We know you are smart enough to discern this but here is the fine print: This site is created as an information resource for dental professionals. Although we try our level best we cannot guarantee the accuracy of content contained herein is not guaranteed; the use of this summary tool is not a substitute for clinical experience and expertise which you abundantly have. 

We expressly disclaim responsibility, and shall have no liability, for any damages, loss, injury, or liability whatsoever suffered as a result of your reliance on the information directly contained in this site.

This is a *work in progress*. Expect more improvements and features over the coming days to weeks.
