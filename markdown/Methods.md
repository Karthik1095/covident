## Search Methods

We intend to publish comprehensive documentation of our efforts but we understand you would like to have a run down, so here we go:

**Search**

We search PUBMED and Google Scholar every 2 weeks to identify relevant literature
	
**Pubmed search strategy:**

("dentistry"[MeSH Terms] OR "dentistry"[All Fields]) AND ((((("COVID-19"[Supplementary Concept] OR "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"[Supplementary Concept]) OR COVID-19[Title/Abstract]) OR coronavirus 19[Title/Abstract]) OR SARS-COV-2[Title/Abstract] OR ("severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"[Supplementary Concept] OR "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"[All Fields] OR "wuhan coronavirus"[All Fields]) AND 2019/12[PDAT] : 2030[PDAT]) OR ("severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"[Supplementary Concept] OR "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"[All Fields] OR "2019 ncov"[All Fields]) OR 2019nCoV[All Fields] OR ("COVID-19"[All Fields] OR "COVID-2019"[All Fields] OR "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"[Supplementary Concept] OR "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"[All Fields] OR "2019-nCoV"[All Fields] OR "SARS-CoV-2"[All Fields] OR "2019nCoV"[All Fields] OR (("Wuhan"[All Fields] AND ("coronavirus"[MeSH Terms] OR "coronavirus"[All Fields])) AND (2019/12[PDAT] OR 2020[PDAT]))) OR ("severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"[Supplementary Concept] OR "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"[All Fields] OR "sars cov 2"[All Fields]))

**Google Scholar:** covid 19 AND dentistry - first 100 articles

**Screening:**

Every article is subjected to two levels (tile and abstract; full text) of blind screening by two reviewers based on inclusion and exclusion criteria below.  If the reviewers disagree on an article, an adjudicator resolves the conflict at each level

**Inclusion criteria**

In keeping with the broad based nature of the topic we include all literature that are deemed relevant to a frontline dental professional during Covid 19 pandemic. No other inclusion criteria were applied. 

**Exclusion criteria:**

Not in the English language

**News articles**

Explanation of journal responses to COVID-19

Articles that pass the multilevel screening process are moved on to data extraction stage, to be included in the knowledge summary

**Rating**

A group of knowledge user volunteers from the dental practising community are asked to rate each selected article for *relevance to clinical practice* and 
*newsworthiness*. Rating is done based on McMasterâ€™s Online Rating of Evidence (MORE) criteria available here

https://hiru.mcmaster.ca/more/physicians/sample_rating_form.htm 

**Data Extraction and summarization:**

Relevant thematic information from the included articles is extracted by a knowledge appraiser. Extracted information is summarized and published online iteratively.

**Limitations**

It is highly likely we have missed some important piece of evidence out there either due to our search strategy or limitation to MEDLINE and google scholar. The summary published online is less technical than some of you might want. Do not worry, we will rectify that in the actual publication.

We have only included peer reviewed literature here to ensure consistent quality, that strategy in itself can exclude quite a few of guidelines and documents available on the web.

**Method courtesy acknowledgment**

We have drawn direct inspiration from https://covidreview.ca/, an excellent covid 19 specific knowledge translation project out of McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario.
