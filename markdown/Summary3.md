


**C. INFECTION CONTROL (General) (8–11)**

1.  Consider all patients as potential asymptomatic carriers.

2. Provide adequate ventilation

3. Remove magazines from the waiting room.

4. Perform body temperature measurement

5. Record detailed medical and travel history for every patient. Consider e-charting over paper charts if feasible.

6. Hand hygiene (patient): Use of hydro alcoholic solutions for hand disinfection when entering the dental office for 20-30 seconds. Alcohol hand sanitizers (at 70% concentration) can also be used, for at least 20 seconds. After the hand wash, use a paper towel to dry.

7. Avoid long stays in the waiting room.
 
8. Avoid the contemporary presence of >2 patients.

9. Respect the distance of 1 m between patients.
 
10. Vent exhaust air outside

11. Discourage the presence of accompanying people.

12. Operators should wear appropriate personal protective equipment ideally consisting of a fluid-resistant mask, visor and apron. 

13. Use triple-layered surgical mask, Particulate respirators (N95 Masks) for routine dental practice and FFP3-standard mask for COVID positive patients. 

14. Use two pairs of gloves during procedures.
 
15. Hand pieces to be autoclaved after each patient. 

16. Disinfect all touched surfaces (0.1% sodium hypochlorite or 70% isopropyl alcohol)
 
17.  Dispose protection items away after each patient. 

18. Treat Covid patients only in Airborne Infection Isolation Rooms (AIIR).

19. Treat discarded PPE and other materials properly - transfer to temporary storage immediately after use, pack in two layered sealed packing.


**D. PRE - TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS(8)**

1. Use a preprocedural rinse to reduce microbial load, especially in the absence of rubber dam and assisted high volume suction. Povidone iodine 0.2% and 0.5% hydrogen peroxide are recommended; chlorhexidine mouthwashes are ineffective against Covid 19.
 
2. Extra oral scrubbing with isopropyl alcohol. 

**E. TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS**

**a. ENDODONTICS (3,4,6,9,12–22)**

i. Use rubber dam

ii. Minimise use of ultrasonics, high speed handpieces and 3 way syringes. If using high speed handpiece use it without exhaust.

iii. Use a powerful air/water surgical suction pump (aspirator) close to the tooth and a second suction close to the nose to prevent aerosol and saliva droplet diffusion.

iv. Dilute the sodium hypochlorite irrigant solution to 1% concentration, to extend the supplies without compromising on treatment outcome

**b. ORAL SURGERY (1,14,16,17,23–25)**

i. Simple extractions should be performed with the patient in supine position.

ii. Closed reduction of fractures should be preferred over open surgery where stability can be achieved without ORIF. 

iii. Where ORIF is absolutely necessary, transcutaneous approach (after applying a bio- occlusive dressing over the mouth post IMF should be preferred over an intraoral approach.

iv. When doing open surgery, scalpel should be preferred over monopolar cautery and repeated suction/irrigation should be minimized; and when achieving haemostasis with bipolar cautery lowest power settings should be used.

v. Absorbable sutures should be preferred.

vi. Rinse  wounds slowly and use the saliva ejector to avoid spraying

vii. Avoid attempting treatment of patients with oral and maxillofacial compound injuries and fascial space infections in dental clinic; refer them to nearby hospital

**c. PERIODONTICS (17)**

i. Use hand scalers instead of ultrasonics.

**d. PROSTHODONTICS (17,24)**
i. Consider relining troublesome dentures to defer treatment, recommended to use over the counter reliners whenever feasible.

ii. Disinfect impressions properly

iii. Use rubber dam for fixed prosthetic procedures

**e. ORAL MEDICINE (6,9,12,14,18,21–23,26)**

i. Prefer extra oral digital radiography over intraoral.

**f. ORTHODONTICS (6)**

i. Use rubber dam while carrying out procedures like loss of a bracket, damage to ligature etc

**g. PEDODONTICS (17)**

i. Avoid toys (soft toys) which can be infected and difficult to disinfect compared to hard toys.

ii. Restraining devices used during the treatment, may be contaminated, and should be disinfected carefully.

**F. EDUCATION, PRACTICE DYNAMICS AND ETHICS**

Most jurisdictions have suspended all but emergency procedures during the acute phase of the pandemic. Ethical considerations of directing patients to local emergency rooms is echoed in some of the included papers. Dental education, not unlike any other education activity has adapted by adopting a predominantly online mode.
